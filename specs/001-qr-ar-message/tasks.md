# Tasks: QR Code AR Message Experience

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-qr-ar-message/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md structure: Next.js web application with pages/, components/, public/, styles/, tests/

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Next.js structure

- [x] T001 Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and required dependencies
- [x] T002 [P] Configure package.json with MindAR.js, Three.js, and QR code libraries
- [x] T003 [P] Setup Next.js configuration for MindAR compatibility in next.config.js
- [x] T004 [P] Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [x] T005 [P] Create basic directory structure: pages/, components/, public/, styles/, tests/
- [x] T006 [P] Setup environment configuration in .env.local

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] **T007**: Create base layout component in `components/Layout.js`
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - Halloween theme styling
  - AR status indicators
  - Navigation structure
- [x] T008 [P] Setup global styles in styles/globals.css

- [x] T011 [P] Implement device capability detection in lib/deviceCapabilities.js
- [x] T012 [P] Setup camera permission handling utilities in lib/cameraUtils.js
- [x] T013 Create base session management in lib/sessionManager.js

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - QR Code Website Access (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can scan a QR code to access the AR experience website with proper instructions

**Independent Test**: Scan generated QR code and successfully load website with AR instructions

### Implementation for User Story 1

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - AR Message Trigger (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can point camera at QR code to trigger AR experience and view Portuguese message

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 QR code but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- API endpoints before components that consume them
- Models and services before components
- Core components before integration components
- Base functionality before error handling and optimization
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch API and components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create QR code generation API endpoint in pages/api/qr-code.js"
Task: "Implement QRDisplay component in components/QRDisplay.js" 
Task: "Create session tracking API endpoint in pages/api/session.js"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch AR components and APIs for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create AR message configuration API in pages/api/ar/message.js"
Task: "Implement device capabilities detection API in pages/api/ar/capabilities.js"
Task: "Create CameraHandler component in components/CameraHandler.js"
Task: "Implement MessageOverlay component in components/MessageOverlay.js"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can scan QR and access website

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! QR scanning works)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full AR experience!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Cross-browser compatibility)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (QR code generation and website access)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (AR functionality and message display)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Browser compatibility)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on MindAR.js integration and QR code dual-purpose functionality
- Test on actual mobile devices for camera and AR functionality
- Ensure Portuguese message displays correctly with proper fonts
- Progressive enhancement ensures graceful fallbacks for unsupported devices
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
