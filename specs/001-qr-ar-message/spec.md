# Feature Specification: QR Code AR Message Experience

**Feature Branch**: `001-qr-ar-message`  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an AR project that will use MindAR.js, basically there will be a QR code that will take to the website, and this QR code will be the marker to trigger the AR with the following message 'O vampiro se esconde no reflexo, mas Rupert percebeu a verdade… Siga-o para a próxima pista antes que ele desapareça também.'"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - QR Code Website Access (Priority: P1)

Users scan a QR code with their mobile device camera to access the AR experience website.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point to the entire experience. Without QR code scanning functionality, users cannot access any part of the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scanning the QR code and successfully loading the website, delivering immediate access to the AR platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a mobile device with camera, **When** they scan the QR code using their device's camera or QR scanning app, **Then** they are redirected to the AR experience website
2. **Given** a user scans the QR code, **When** the website loads, **Then** they see instructions for the AR experience and camera permission prompts

### User Story 2 - AR Message Trigger (Priority: P2)

Users point their device camera at the same QR code to trigger the AR experience and view the interactive message.

**Why this priority**: This is the core AR functionality that delivers the interactive content experience. It builds upon the website access to provide the immersive AR component.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by pointing the camera at the QR code from within the website and seeing the Portuguese message appear in AR overlay.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the AR website with camera access, **When** they point their camera at the QR code, **Then** the AR experience activates and displays the message "O vampiro se esconde no reflexo, mas Rupert percebeu a verdade… Siga-o para a próxima pista antes que ele desapareça também."
2. **Given** the AR experience is active, **When** the user moves their device, **Then** the message remains anchored to the QR code location
3. **Given** the AR message is displayed, **When** the user moves the camera away from the QR code, **Then** the AR message disappears from view

### User Story 3 - Cross-Device Compatibility (Priority: P3)

Users can access the AR experience on various mobile devices and browsers without additional app downloads.

**Why this priority**: Ensures broad accessibility but is not critical for core functionality. Can be implemented after core features work on primary platforms.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the experience on different mobile browsers and device types, confirming consistent AR message display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an iOS device, **When** they access the AR experience through Safari, **Then** the AR functionality works correctly
2. **Given** a user has an Android device, **When** they access the AR experience through Chrome, **Then** the AR functionality works correctly

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the QR code is partially obscured or damaged?
- How does the system handle insufficient lighting conditions for QR code detection?
- What occurs when camera permissions are denied by the user?
- How does the system behave when the QR code is too far away or too close to detect properly?
- What happens if the user's device doesn't support WebAR features?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a QR code that serves both as a website URL and AR marker
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the Portuguese message "O vampiro se esconde no reflexo, mas Rupert percebeu a verdade… Siga-o para a próxima pista antes que ele desapareça também." when the QR code is detected in AR mode
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to scan the QR code using standard mobile device cameras or QR scanning applications
- **FR-004**: System MUST request and handle camera permissions for AR functionality
- **FR-005**: System MUST anchor the AR message to the QR code position in 3D space
- **FR-006**: System MUST work in web browsers without requiring additional app downloads
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback when QR code is detected and AR experience begins
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle cases where camera access is denied with appropriate user messaging
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide fallback messaging when AR features are not supported on the device

### Key Entities

- **QR Code**: Physical or digital marker that contains the website URL and serves as the AR tracking target
- **AR Message**: Portuguese text content that appears as an overlay when the QR code is detected
- **Web Session**: User's interaction session from QR scan through AR experience completion

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully scan the QR code and access the website within 5 seconds on standard mobile devices
- **SC-002**: AR message appears within 2 seconds of pointing camera at the QR code
- **SC-003**: 95% of users with WebAR-capable devices can view the AR message successfully
- **SC-004**: AR message remains stable and readable when viewed from different angles and distances (0.3m to 2m from QR code)
- **SC-005**: System works correctly on at least 90% of mobile devices tested (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Assumptions

- Users have mobile devices with camera functionality
- Target devices support WebAR capabilities for AR message display
- QR code will be displayed in adequate lighting conditions for camera detection
- Users are familiar with basic QR code scanning or will receive simple instructions
- The Portuguese message content is final and will not require localization
- The AR experience is designed for single-user interaction (not collaborative)
